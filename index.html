<h2> Here are some of my top picks</h2> 
<ol>
<li> La Roche Possay's Effeclar clensear</li>
<p> Every person with a great skincare routine knows that clensear is the correct first step. Not only does this remove oil, dirt, and sebum that has built up over the day, but it also can help close your pores. The best way to keep acne off your face is by cleansing in the evening and morning. The effeclar clensar is made with Salicylic Acid, which is one of the best ingredits for targeting acne. </p>
<li> CeraVe's Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser made with Benzoyl peroxide is also a fan favorite, esspecially for backne.</li>
<p> The next step is toner! Some people say it's optinal, I visited a skin specialist and she said that not only is it important but if you have the right one it can help prevent acne. She gave me a toner made from Calendula extract. Because it was from her own brand which is not in stores i found the next best one.
